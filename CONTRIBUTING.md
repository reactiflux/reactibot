There are subtle issues when making some chaings. These are notes for steps to take to make sure it's done correctly when needed.

## Environment variables

Adding a new environment variable needs to be done in several places to work corectly and be predictable for new developers:

- Add to the action in `.github/workflows/node.js.yml`
- Add to the Kubernetes config under `cluster/deployment.yml
