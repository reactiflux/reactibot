Most of the time, JWTs aren't the best approach for working with backend authentication, despite the multitude of tutorials that use JWT. Sessions have been used for decades, with a lot of back end frameworks supporting them out of the box.

That said there are also scenarios when using a JWT token is the best approach:

- When using a third party auth service ( OpenID, Auth0, Firestore)
- Service to service calls
- Distributed architectures ( i.e Microservices)

- Memory may be important if you plan on running containers (common as part of typical development flows) or emulators for mobile devices. Look for a laptop with at least 16GB of memory.
- Consumer-targeted laptops tend to be less repairable and receive less support over long periods of time than business laptops.

Here are a few recommendations for laptops:
- Dell Latitude or XPS
- Lenovo Thinkpad
- Apple Macbook (avoid models with butterfly keyboards)
