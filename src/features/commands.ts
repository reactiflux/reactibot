Prettier is a modern and well-supported formatter that completely reformats your code to be more readable and follow best practices.

To format some code without installing anything, use the playground: https://prettier.io/playground/
To enforce its style in your projects, use the CLI: https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html
To integrate it into your editor: https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html`,
